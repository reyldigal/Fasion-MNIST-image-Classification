##1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset? **ANSWER**: it is a Machine Learning used to train and testing for classification model
##2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training? 
###**ANSWER**: it is because using image pixil values is more iffective in training images it Train the model faster
##3 List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.
###**ANSWER**: layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),layers.Dense(10),layers.Softmax()
##4. What does an epoch mean in model training?
